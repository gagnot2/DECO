            <h3> Are You a Good Fit? </h2>
            <p>
                The answer is yes! Or at least an encouraging most likely.
            <br><br>
                DECO is open to all forms of designers and creators. Whether it be industrial, graphic, packaging, UI/UX, or whatever, we always welcome new skillsets and contributors! 
            <br><br>
                Additionally, we welcome all skill levels. DECO is a place for designers to grow and improve, so if you're new and just interested in trying your hand at a form of design, we wholeheartedly encourage you to come to one of our events or meetings! If you're a hardened and experienced design--also awesome. Your experience and skills are valued, and we'd love to provide you opportunities that fit your needs. Whether it be teaching others what you've learned by hosting a workshop, connecting you with other creators to help you develop a project you've been thinking about, or even just helping you present and market your work through portfolio advice!
            </p>

            <h3> Help Us Help You!</h2>
            <p>
                All in all, DECO is what you make of it. We're still in the early stages, so we're looking for your feedback to know what RPI designers need and want. Vocalize what you're looking for, and we'll work with you to make it happen.
